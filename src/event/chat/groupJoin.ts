Here is a brief overview of how this chat works:
-   This chat is *admin only*. Only I (the bot) can send messages here.

-   For the best experience, please mute this chat. You will be @mentioned when you have homework due, and this will override your mute settings.
    You will only be notified if the homework is for a class you are subscribed to, and if you have not muted the assignment.

-   You are currently not registered to receive any notifications. In order to begin using this chat, you must first register with your name. To do this, send a message in the following format:
    \`\`\`!register <Your Name>\`\`\`

-   Once you have registered, you can subscribe to classes. You will only receive notifications for classes you are subscribed to.

-   To see a list of all the classes you can subscribe to, send a message in the following format:
    \`\`\`!classes\`\`\`

-   To subscribe to a class, send a message in the following format:
    \`\`\`!subscribe <class name>\`\`\`, or \`\`\`!subscribe <class number>\`\`\`
    For example, to subscribe to the class "Linear Algebra I", you would send the following message:
    \`\`\`!subscribe Linear Algebra I\`\`\`

-   To unsubscribe from a class, send a message in the following format:    
    \`\`\`!unsubscribe <class name>\`\`\` or \`\`\`!unsubscribe <class number>\`\`\`

-   To see a list of all the classes you are subscribed to, send a message in the following format:    
    \`\`\`!list\`\`\`
